            Lucy’s knee joint was almost identical to the knee joint found in 1973 that was confirmed to be of an
            upright walking creature. Dr. Johanson used the confirmation of the knee joint he found the previous year to
            confirm that there were hominids that walked erect three-million-years ago in Hadar. With the discovery of
            Lucy, another knee joint was used to further support that there were creatures with bipedal abilities at
            that time including Lucy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify line-space fs-5 col-12">
            Lucy’s bipedal ability caused much controversy in the science world due to her hipbone. Although her knee
            joint and legs pointed in the direction of bipedalism, Lucy’s hipbone said otherwise. Lucy still had many
            ape-like features and her hip bone resembled a chimpanzee’s which would have made it impossible for Lucy to
            walk upright (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Owen Lovejoy, the same anthropologist who confirmed the
            upright walking knee bone for Dr. Johanson in 1973 realized that Lucy’s hipbone was fossilized in an odd way
            (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Lovejoy suggested that Lucy’s pelvis was crushed by other wandering
            animals when her body lied in the lake causing the hipbone to later fuse together through early
            fossilization (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). The fuse caused the two pieces of the pelvis together so
            well that it looked like a flair hipbone of a chimp (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Lovejoy then
            recreated how Lucy’s hipbone may have looked using plaster to make a copy of the discovered hipbone and cut
            out the damaged pieces and put them back together forming a hipbone that looks just like a human (In Search
            of Human Origins, 1997). The work supported Lucy’s bipedal ability and provided a certainty to the questions
            posed about early bipedalism because she was a clear example of ape-sized brained creature that had a pelvis
            and legs almost identical to a modern human (Johanson, 181).

        <p class="text-justify line-space fs-5 col-12">
            In 1976, Mary Leakey, an archaeologist and paleoanthropologist stumbled upon animal tracks cemented into
            volcanic ashes in Laetoli, Tanzania (Smithsonian NMNH, 2020). In 1978, Paul Abell joined Leakey and found
            the 88 feet long footprint trail with about 70 early human footprints now referred as “The Laetoli
            Footprints” (Smithsonian NMNH, 2020). There were footprints from at least two individuals walking side by
            side (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). The distribution of the weight in the footprint appeared to be
            human because the heel was placed down first followed by the lateral edge of the foot and then the ball and
            toes (Leakey, 86). The footprints suggested that the early humans that left the prints were bipedal and had
            more human-like than ape-like features (Smithsonian NMNH, 2020). The evidence of the footprints plus the
            sediment layer it was found in suggested that the footprints were made by an Australopithecus afarensis
            because they were the only known early human in the region at the time (Smithsonian NMNH, 2020). Lucy was
            also classified as an Australopithecus afarensis and the footprints further support that Lucy was bipedal.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify line-space fs-5 col-12">
            Owen Lovejoy also did a comparative study of the Laetoli Footprints found by Mary Leaky and he strongly
            suggested that the footprints found were of a biped. When comparing the footprints found at Laetoli to a
            human print from a crime scene, Lovejoy described it as “virtually indistinguishable” and when the Laetoli
            prints were compared to that of a chimpanzee whom is occasionally a biped, there was a clear difference (In
            Search of Human Origins, 1997). The footprints at Laetoli shows the great toe in line with the rest of the
            toes just like humans creating an arch in the print (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Lovejoy continued on
            by saying that the footprints were from a biped that has been an upright walking creature for a very long
            time (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). This supports the theory that the footprints found at Laetoli
            indeed are from a biped perhaps Lucy’s kind.

        <p class="text-justify line-space fs-5 col-12">
            There have been many questions about why Lucy walked upright especially with the surprising fact that she
            walked upright with a small brain. Before the discovery of Lucy, many believed that tool-using and brain
            enlargement came before bipedality and was possibly responsible for its development (Johanson, 181). Lucy
            shut down those theories but raised questions as to why did she walk upright. Dr. Johanson suggested two
            theories to answer that question; (1) the changing environment and (2) Lucy’s social structure.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify line-space fs-5 col-12">
        <ul>
            <li class="text-justify line-space fs-5 pb-5">(1) The first theory suggested by Dr. Johanson is the changing
                environment. The changing environment can be the reason for Lucy’s bipedal ability because the adaption
                was required for survival. Before Lucy’s time, the climate of tropical Africa was changing with
                alternating seasons, wet and dry and less rainfall causing the dense forest to shrink (In Search of
                Human Origins, 1997). The shrinking of the forest caused many changes to the animals that lived and
                relied on the forest for survival. Although it was suggested that Lucy became a walker while still
                dependent on the forest, her bipedalism allowed for her and her kinds to survive the changing
                environment (In Search of Human Origins, 1997).
            </li>
            <li class="text-justify line-space fs-5 pb-5">(2) The second theory suggest by Dr. Johanson is Lucy’s social
                structure is responsible for her bipedalism. Owen Lovejoy carried out a comparative study that suggested
                that social structure and sex may have been the reason for Lucy’s bipedalism. Mary Leakey’s discovery of
                the Laetoli footprints also supports that the social structure caused Lucy and her kind to walk upright.
                The apes follow a harem social structure which is when a single, large male controls a small group of
                females (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Since the footprints only show about two individuals walking
                side by side, theory suggest that the two bipeds may have been in a monogamous relationship instead of
                the harem social structure. The theory is that to better reproduce, Lucy and her kinds became bipedal to
                have more babies (Johanson, 130).
