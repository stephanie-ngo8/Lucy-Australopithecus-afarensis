                    The paleoanthropological work began in Hadar, Ethiopia in the early 1970s by Dr. Donald Johanson and his team. The work was divided into four sections, four joint Hadar field seasons. The first Hadar field season began in the fall 1973 and that was when Dr. Johanson found the knee joint that later led to the discovery of Lucy (Johanson, L., 2008). 
Dr. Johanson was out one afternoon surveying when he kicked up the proximal tibia—the upper end of the shinbone—thinking it was a hippo rib (Johanson, 155). At first Dr. Johanson believed it was of a small primate but a few yards away lied another piece of bone (Johanson, 155). That bone turned out to be a distal femur—the lower end of a thighbone—that was split in the middle with one of its condyles attached (Johanson, 155). Dr. Johanson also found a third piece that was the other condyle and attached all three pieces together to form a knee joint, all the pieces fit together perfectly and were the same size and color (Johanson, 155). Using biostratigraphic evidence, Dr. Johanson concluded that the fossil was about three-million years old (Johanson, 163).                </p>

                    Dr. Johanson then believed that the owner of the knee joint was of a hominid when he realized that the tibia and femur connected at an angle similar to a human instead of a straight line like those of a monkey (Johanson, 155). 
The angle of the tibia and femur connected convinced Dr. Johanson that it belonged to a hominid as well as the shape of the knee joint seen from the side, a knee joint of a human is oval shaped and a knee of joint of an ape is round (Johanson, 156). The knee joint shape of the three-million-year-old fossil is also oval shaped thus convincing Dr. Johanson even further. Dr. Johanson then compared the discovered femur to one of a modern human and stated that they were “virtually identical” except for the size (Johanson, 159). Dr. Johanson also received confirmation from Mary and Richard Leakey, two prominent scientists that the fossil was the knee joint of hominid (Johanson, 162). Another confirmation came from Owen Lovejoy, an anthropologist and professor at Kent State University. Lovejoy confirmed to Dr. Johanson that the owner of the knee joint walked upright (Johanson, 163).
