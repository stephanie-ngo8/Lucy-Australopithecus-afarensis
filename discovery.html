            With the successful discovery of the knee joint in 1973, there was no problem with planning another
            expedition the following year. Dr. Johanson and his team of scientist went back for the second Hadar field
            season hoping to find something even more to support the knee joint discovery. On the morning of November
            24, 1974, Dr. Johanson had a hunch that it was going to be his lucky day and decided to go back to the gully
            he did not finish working on the day before (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Just as Dr. Johanson was
            going to drive back to the camp, he stumbled upon a small piece of bone and when he scanned the surrounding
            area he realized that there were bits of a leg, bits of a skull and a little piece of a jaw (In Search of
            Human Origins, 1997). Dr. Johanson found almost an entire skeleton that noon known today as Lucy. Throughout
            history there has never been a skeleton as old as three-million-years-old ever discovered.

            There were hundreds of tiny fragments collected that had to be carefully cleaned and the pelvis took hours
            to piece together (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). The shape of the lower jaw and the details of the
            teeth conveyed to the team that it was a mixture of ape and human-like features which have never been seen
            before (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). As the team continued to piece the skeleton together, the
            knee-joint found was modern and human-like just like the one Dr. Johanson discovered last year and the
            creature was a tiny female adult that stood about three and half feet tall with a small brain (In Search of
            Human Origins, 1997).

            Lucy was classified as Australopithecus afarensis. It was clear to Dr. Johanson that she was not human
            because she was too little, her brain was too small and her jaw was the wrong shape (Johanson, 258). During
            Dr. Johanson’s expedition in Hadar, he found bones to many animals such as pigs and elephants suggesting
            that the original environment of Hadar were lush and green, there were rivers and lakes with communities of
            animals living in and beside the water (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Over time, Hadar’s environment
            changed with the alternating seasons and shrinking of the forest due to less rainfall. The changing
            environment caused other animals to adapt, such as a new species of antelope and the quick reproduction of
            monkeys which increased its population and pushed out the slower reproducing apes except for Lucy (In Search
            of Human Origins, 1997). Lucy’s upright walking helped her and her kind to compete in the new changing
            environment because when the forest became sparse, Lucy and her kinds were able to survive by walking across
            grassland to reach the trees that had her food (In Search of Human Origins, 1997). Bipedalism allowed Lucy
            and her kind to have their hands free to carry the food they found and that was all they needed to survive
            (In Search of Human Origins, 1997).
