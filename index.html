                    Throughout history there has been many questions about the origins of human. There have been multiple misconceptions such as Asia being the cradle of mankind or the hoax of the Piltdown Man. For a long time, scientist did not have the answers to the questions of mankind until the discovery of Lucy by Dr. Donald Johanson and his team of scientists. The discovery began with the finding of a bipedal knee joint in Hadar, Ethiopia in 1973 (Rafferty, 2020). The following year, Dr. Johanson and his team of scientists continued to excavate the area and discovered more than forty percent of a single hominid skeleton in 1974 (“Lucy”, 2013). That skeleton is known as Lucy and dated back to 3.2 million years ago (“Lucy”, 2013). Lucy was classified as the first known member of Australopithecus afarensis that had a humanlike pelvis which provided scientist with the knowledge that Lucy was a fully upright walking hominin (“Lucy”, 2013). Lucy died around 11-12 years of age and stood about 3 feet 7 inches tall and weighed about 60 pounds (“Lucy”, 2013). The discovery of Lucy brought to light answers to the questions about the evolution of humankind and it was clear that Lucy was the missing link that tied everything together.
